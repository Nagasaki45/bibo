Why bibo?
=========

There are many reference managers out there, so why writing another one? bibo is different for a few reasons:

1. It relies solely on your ``.bib`` file to track information. This is bibo's main selling point! Your ``.bib`` file and your other files (PDFs, for example) are exactly where you want them to be. You have full control over your data.
2. Being a command line tool, integration with other command line applications is easy and powerful.
3. It's extensible with plugins (more on this later).
