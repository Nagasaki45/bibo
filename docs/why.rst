Why bibo?
=========

There are many reference managers out there, so why writing another one? bibo is different for a few reasons:

- Your ``.bib`` and other files (e.g. pdfs) are exactly where you want them.
- No need to export ``.bib`` files.
- Enjoy the power of the command line.
- Extensible with plugins.
